## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Connects to Wi-Fi, initializes sensors, and establishes Telegram Bot link.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Sends OTP on user request via Telegram
   - Verifies OTP and unlocks servo motor-based lock
   - Invalid OTP triggers buzzer alert
3. **Environment Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitors temperature and humidity
   - Activates fan relay above a temperature threshold
   - Detects nearby objects and updates LED indicator
4. **Motion Detection**:
   - Detects motion using PIR sensor
   - Controls a relay-connected device based on movement
5. **Notifications**:
   - Sends real-time Telegram alerts for all major events
